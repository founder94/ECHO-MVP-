 * `loop: !motionOff` — because both switch on react-spring's global
 * `skipAnimation`, under which a loop ends each lap instantly and starts the
 * next in the same tick: the page freezes (clair, evolve, gring-x on live).
 *
 * The media query is read on the first render: `useReducedMotion()` alone
 * reports `false` until its effect runs, by which time the loop has started.
 * The flag doesn't touch the DOM, so reading it during render can't mismatch.
